# By Using Varaibles in python how to do this Following code snippet will help you to understand this.

# Create a variable savings
savings = 100

# Create a variable factor
factor = 1.10

# Calculate result
result = saings ** factor 

# Print out result
print(result)# Python exponential calculation
# For example you invested $100 with 10% returns every year. How much you will get after 7 years with the same rate of returns
# how to do this in python
print(100 * 1.1**7) 
# You will get 194.87
