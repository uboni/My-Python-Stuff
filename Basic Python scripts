# By Using Varaibles in python how to do this Following code snippet will help you to understand this.



# Create a variable savings
savings = 100

# Create a variable factor
factor = 1.10

# Calculate result
result = savings * factor**7

# Print out result
print(result)
# output would be 194.871


# Create a variable desc
desc = "compound interest"
# Here desc is of str data type. In python you can either put strings in double quotrs or single quotes
# Create a variable profitable
profitable = True
# in the above statement profitable is bool data type which represents either True or False

Data Types in Python
int
float
str
bool
to know the data type of a variable use this
type(x)--> prints type of data x holds


# Several variables to experiment with
savings = 100
factor = 1.1
desc = "compound interest"

# Assign product of factor and savings to year1
year1 = savings * factor

# Print the type of year1
print(type(year1))

# Assign sum of desc and desc to doubledesc
doubledesc = desc + desc

# Print out doubledesc
print(doubledesc)


# Following task will convert one data type to other using type function

# Definition of savings and result
savings = 100
result = 100 * 1.10 ** 7

# Fix the printout
print("I started with $" + str(savings) + " and now have $" + str(result) + ". Awesome!")

# Definition of pi_string
pi_string = "3.1415926"

# Convert pi_string into float: pi_float
pi_float = float(pi_string)
